                    As an Embedded Systems Engineer at UBC Solar since September 2023, At UBC Solar, I have
                    worked on both firmware and testing related projects. In particular, I wrote a library to
                    create an abstraction for logging messages on an SD Card. Using C/C++, the STM32Cube IDE,
                    and a Nucleo board, I developed protocols to open, append to, and close files on the SD
                    Card with a FATFS file system. providing essential functions for opening, appending, and
                    closing files on a FATFS file system on an SD card. My library allowed my embedded team
                    and the vehicle dynamics team to have an easy-to-use abstraction at their hands without
                    having to worry about nuances in appending to files on the SD Card. Overall, in the
                    project I sharpened my C/C++ skills, familiarity with debugging in the STM32Cube IDE, and
                    connecting an SPI peripheral.

                    In terms of my testing project, I developed a Python script to check through a PCAN view
                    log and check for any errors in data or ID's passed. Additionally, my script implements
                    jitter analysis by checking the CAN bus load as a result of the sent messages. This script
                    allowed us to quickly test the received messages from our boards to rapidly develop them
                    as well as provide a flexible test suite. Overall, through this project I learned the
                    standard frame of a CAN message, how interference occurs on the CAN bus, using DBC files,
                    and using the cantools library.

                As a first year developer at UBC AgroBot I worked mainly in Python to create practical
                algorithms for image recognition. I learned OpenCV and machine learning to fulfill my role in
                developing a leaf area estimation model for our robot. Specifically, I developed a program
                that identifies contours of plants while disregarding weeds.
