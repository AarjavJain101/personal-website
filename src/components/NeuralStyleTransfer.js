                Through the Convolutional Neural Networks course offered by DeepLearning AI, one of the many
                concepts I learned was <strong>Neural Style Transfer</strong>. Using this technique I
                generated the (middle) image using the two side images â€‹(left = context image, right = style
                image). This was done using a{" "}
                <strong>
                    loss function defined based on a pre-trained VGG-19 CNN and then optimized in Python
                </strong>{" "}
                to obtain the most closely related image possible.
